I am a PhD student in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, interested in Hardware Reliability, Computer Architecture and Sustainability. I work with Professor [Caroline Trippel](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/trippel/) on detecting and mitigating hardware defects in datacenter CPUs. Before joining Stanford, I completed my MEng in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), Greece.

I collaborate closely with Google to develop improved system-level tests for detecting [Silent Data Corruptions](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/10759085?hl=en) at scale. In Summer 2025, I will intern at Google DeepMind, working on the reliability of machine learning workloads.
