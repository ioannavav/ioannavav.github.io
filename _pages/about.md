I am a PhD student in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, interested in Hardware Reliability, Computer Architecture and Sustainability. I work with Professor [Caroline Trippel](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/trippel/) on devising system-level tests for detecting hardware defects in datacenter CPUs. Before joining Stanford, I completed my MEng in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), Greece.
